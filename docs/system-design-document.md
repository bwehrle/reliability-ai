# **Imaginary Microservice System Documentation**

---

## **Overview**
The microservice system is composed of three services—**Service A**, **Service B**, and **Service C**—that work collaboratively to deliver a robust, scalable, and decoupled application. The system relies on asynchronous communication using message queues, which provides resilience and scalability while ensuring loose coupling between services.

---

### **Service A: The Consumer and Processor**
#### **Description**
Service A is the primary consumer and processor of data within the system. It depends on **Service B** and **Service C**, which produce and publish data asynchronously to dedicated messaging channels. Service A listens to these channels, processes the incoming data, and performs downstream actions based on the business logic.

#### **Responsibilities**
1. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Collects data from both Service B and Service C via asynchronous communication channels (e.g., Amazon SQS, Kafka).
2. **Business Logic Processing**:
   - Processes the incoming data to derive insights, generate reports, or execute workflows.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues (DLQs) to handle failures gracefully.
4. **State Management**:
   - Optionally maintains state or intermediate results for multi-step processing workflows.
5. **Metrics and Monitoring**:
   - Emits logs and metrics for tracking system performance and debugging.

#### **Communication Pattern**
Service A follows a **pub-sub model**:
- **Inbound Communication**:
  - Subscribes to topics or queues associated with Service B and Service C.
  - Handles messages independently to ensure responsiveness.
- **Outbound Communication**:
  - Can optionally publish results or events to downstream services.

#### **Technical Stack**
- **Message Queue**: Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, or Kafka (consumer).
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Deployment**: Containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, running on AWS EKS.

#### **Configuration**
- **Message Processing**:
  - Concurrency: Configurable thread pool for parallel processing of messages.
  - Batch Size: Supports batching for increased throughput.
  - Acknowledgment: Ensures messages are acknowledged only after successful processing.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Retry Policy: Retries failed messages a configurable number of times.
  - Dead-Letter Queue: Failed messages are redirected to a DLQ for later inspection.

#### **Dependencies**
1. **Service B**:
   - Publishes real-time data streams (e.g., metrics, events, or transactions) to a dedicated topic or queue consumed by Service A.
2. **Service C**:
   - Produces complementary data (e.g., metadata, enrichment information) for Service A to use alongside Service B’s data.

---

### **Service B: Real-Time Data Producer**
#### **Description**
Service B is responsible for producing and publishing real-time data streams, such as metrics, events, or transactional logs, to a message channel. These data streams are consumed by Service A for processing.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Collects or generates data from internal or external sources.
- Publishes data asynchronously to a dedicated queue or topic.
- Implements fault tolerance to guarantee data delivery.

---

### **Service C: Metadata or Enrichment Producer**
#### **Description**
Service C complements Service B by generating and publishing metadata or enrichment information. It enables Service A to process data holistically by combining Service B’s real-time streams with Service C’s contextual or enriched data.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Produces contextual data, such as user profiles, configurations, or reference information.
- Publishes data asynchronously to its respective queue or topic.

---

### **System Communication Flow**
1. **Data Production**:
   - Service B generates real-time data and publishes it to **Queue/Topic B**.
   - Service C produces enrichment data and publishes it to **Queue/Topic C**.

2. **Data Consumption**:
   - Service A listens to both **Queue/Topic B** and **Queue/Topic C** asynchronously.
   - It processes messages independently as they arrive.

3. **Processing Logic**:
   - Service A correlates or aggregates data from both sources (if needed).
   - Processes the combined dataset and generates outputs or performs actions.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. Service B generates an event: **"Transaction Created: ID 12345"**.
2. Service C publishes metadata: **"Transaction ID 12345: Customer Profile Data"**.
3. Service A consumes both messages:
   - Correlates Transaction ID 12345 with its metadata.
   - Processes the enriched transaction data.
   - Publishes results or takes an action, such as generating a report or triggering an alert.

---

### **Key Advantages of Architecture**
1. **Scalability**:
   - Services operate independently and can scale based on their individual workloads.
2. **Resilience**:
   - Asynchronous communication ensures that temporary failures in one service do not disrupt the others.
3. **Flexibility**:
   - Services can be updated, replaced, or extended without tightly coupling changes across the system.

---

### **Monitoring and Metrics**
1. **Service A**:
   - Message lag in queues/topics (e.g., number of unprocessed messages).
   - Processing throughput (messages/second).
2. **Service B & C**:
   - Publishing rates (messages/second).
   - Message delivery success rates.
